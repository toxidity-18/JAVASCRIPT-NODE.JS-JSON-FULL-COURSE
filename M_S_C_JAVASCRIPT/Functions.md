## Introduction to functions in javascript : 
- When we wrap code it more easier to re-use and help managecontrol flow execution 
- This is the most important unit of your code , it groups related-code together and make it easier to reuse and debug and improve .
- Meaning of the word abstraction : This emans to pull-away or take-away thus helps to shorten words or activities .
## How are funtions abstractions ...
- Function combine series of step under a new name .
- Meaning of the word function : this is an object which contains a series of js statements that are executed or called upon multiple times ...
- Abstraction relates to the function name ...
- Meaning of the word to invoke : is to call upon a function thus to execute the code or js_st .
- Look at code ln  2 to 25 : 

   i.e 

      - function convo has abstracted 3 activities into one activity 
      - function SDF_FT13 has abtracted 3 activities into one activity ..
-  Structure for writing a function 

   i.e 

```
   - function ...(){
   - };
```
## How to call a function ...
- To call a function we use the invocation operator () .
- What kind of error do we get when we invoke a function that has not been declared.
   ``` 
   Uncaught ReferenceError: best is not defined
   ```
## Define generalization ...
- The process of moving concrete to abstract is called generalization .
## Demo generalization with use of parameters and arguements ...
- Will apply string interpolation to check code ln 28 to 36 .. Make sure to keep a look out on the backticks .
- Basically generalize means to make our codes more easier and better .
- The meaning of the word parameter : Locally scoped variable which are reusable ..
- How to shorten or generalize with use of parameter code ln 38 to 44
## Demo function as return values  ...
- If you visit the ATM you exepct money paper money ... likewise with javascript which return value from a function .
