# AM BACK IN THAT MODE AGAIN ...

## Comparision in JavaScript

1 ) To identify equality operators and compare numbers with relational operators .

2 ) The four main example of equality operators are :

    -strict equality operator ( === ):returns true if both the value and data type are the same 
    -loose equality operator ( == )
    -strict inequality operator ( !== )
    -loose inequality operator ( != )

3 ) What is the main difference between strict and loose equality operators .

### STRICT EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY OPERATOR .{Line 1-14}

- What is TYPE CONVERSION ? and how it relates to strict equality operators .
- Strict Equality Operator ( === ) does not perform type conversion and only return true if both the value and data type are the same .
- Strict Inequality Operator (!==)will only return TRUE if the value and data type are not the same .
  
### LOOSE EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY OPERATOR .{14-28}

- What is TYPE CONVERSION ? and how it relates to loose equality operators .
- Loose equality operator (==) returns true if the value are equal or if it can perform a type conversion .
- Loose inequality operator (!=) will return true if the value are not equal or if it can perform a type conversion or is the exact opposite LEO .
