# AM BACK IN THAT MODE AGAIN ...

## Comparision in JavaScript

1 ) To identify equality operators and compare numbers with relational operators .

2 ) The four main example of equality operators are :

    -strict equality operator ( === ):returns true if both the value and data type are the same 
    -loose equality operator ( == )
    -strict inequality operator ( !== )
    -loose inequality operator ( != )

3 ) What is the main difference between strict and loose equality operators .

### STRICT EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY OPERATOR .{Line 1-14}

- What is TYPE CONVERSION ? and how it relates to strict equality operators .
- Strict Equality Operator ( === ) does not perform type conversion and only return true if both the value and data type are the same .
- Strict Inequality Operator (!==)will only return TRUE if the value and data type are not the same .
  
### LOOSE EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY OPERATOR .{14-28} [https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/]

- What is TYPE CONVERSION ? and how it relates to loose equality operators .
- Loose equality operator (==) returns true if the value are equal or if it can perform a type conversion .
- Loose inequality operator (!=) will return true if the value are not equal or if it can perform a type conversion or is the exact opposite LEO .    
- This explains alot about the type conversions ..

## COMPARE NUMBERS WITH RELATIONAL OPERATORS .{30-35}
1 ) We have a total of 4 relational in javascript ..i.e
   
   a) Greater than ( > )

   b) Less than ( < )

   c) Greater than or equal to ( >= )

   d) Less than or equal to ( <= )

NB : Type conversion when comparing non-numbers to numbers 
   -when comparing a string with a number but the string ought to contain a value of a number .{36-39}
