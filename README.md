##  JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES 
1 ) How do we save information to a variable through use of assignment expressions .

2 ) "Storing" value or information to a variable gives as the pleasure of re-using that value in our code .

3 ) Meaning of variable a container which stores information or a value for later retrieval .

4 ) Computer whole container/containment  ship .
    
    Variable - metal container for loading cargo - assignment expression .
    
    Each container has a label/variable - lookup expression .
    
    Importance of look up expression - to find the container with the label we want .

### Rule of naming variables
5 ) The following make up the rule of namimg any variable .
  
   -Always start with "LOWERCASE LETTERS"
   
   -Make use of camel case (first letter of each word is uppercase) . NB :Dont snake cae hem .

   -Avoid JS reversed words or future reserved words , ie . https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Reserved_keywords_as_of_ECMAScript_2015 or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Future_reserved_keywords

   -Take note of the words which you use . Remember that Javascript and javaScript - quit different .

### Intializing a variable 
1 ) Declare it then assign a value to it 

2 ) Means : dcelare using (reversed words ie : let const ) and then assign a value to it using assignment expression .

NB: Don't use var ... N/A 

3 ) How to intialize , declare and assign a value to a variable [line of code 1-6]

4 ) Applying lookup expressions using the node shell [line 1-6]


5 ) Main advantage of let to var : You cannot redeclare the ame variable twice .[Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'him/ or any other name given to our variable' has already been declared]
