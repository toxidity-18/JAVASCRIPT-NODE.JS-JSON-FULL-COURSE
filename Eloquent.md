# WELCOME TO FULL JAVASCRIPT COURSE WORK .{JS ELOQUENT}

## INTRODUCTION 
- Programming the art of creating a program or a set of instruction which tell a computer what to do 
- Programming language is artificial constructed language which tell a computer what to do .
- Javascript was introduced in the 1995 as away to add web page to NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR BROSWER
- Meaning of the word code -text which makes up a program  
- To program I hvae to master the art of learning how to read and understand code .

### VALUE TYPES AND OPERATORS 
- The main idea is to read modify and create data .
- To create a value you just need to invoke . Value my include number functions strings etc
  ### ...NUMBERS 
- Usually rep with the use of digits 
- How to write the short form for huge valued numbers [ ln 9 to 12 ]
  
  eg 2.54e3 ie simply means 2.54*10powerto3 = 2540
  ### ...ARITHMETICS  [ ln 21 to 24 ]
- Taking more than two valued numbers to produce a new number .
- Mathematical symbols in Js is known as operators.
- Examples of Operators 
  
  eg 

  - Addition + .
  - Subtraction - .
  - Multiplication * .
  - Division / .
  - Remainder % or Modulo .
-  NB : That Bodmas my apply in this arithmetic operators .
-  Operators with the same precedence 
    
    eg

    - [+ and - ]
    - [* , % and / ]
  ### ...SPECIAL NUMBERS 
  - These means that they dont behave like normal numbers .
  
    eg 

    - Infinity 
    - [-infinity]
    - NaN i.e Not a number [ ln 25 ]
   - NB : That the NaN mainly rp value which do not make any
          sense at all .
   ### ...STRINGS 
   - Mainly rp inside quotes thus rp pieces of text which 
     may be double single or back quotes .[ ln 28 to 32 ].
   - NB : Quotes have to match ... from start to the end .
   - How to place quotes within quotes you apply the use of backslash thus known as escaping of characters [ ln 34 ]
   -
